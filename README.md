To operate the microcontroller you will need the micropython firmware.
Follow these steps to flash the firmware onto your Pico WH:
1. Download the micropython firmware which you will find [here.](https://www.micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/)
2. While holding down the BOOTSEL button on the Pico WH plug it in to your computer.
3. You should now see the microcontroller as a USB drive on the computer.
4. Simply drag the firmware file to the USB drive to copy it onto the Pico WH.
The USB drive should now dissapear wich means the process was successfully done.
### IDE
Using Visual Studio Code to program the Pico WH microcontroller,
